package com.example.camel.route;

Based on your instructions to correct an error in a Java class that appears as though it contains illegal characters (specifically '`'), I will attempt to fix the provided code snippet by removing any such occurrences and ensuring it's syntactically valid. Please note, however, without seeing exactly where these errors are occurring within the context of this environment or IDE setup specifics is challenging; thus my correction focuses on general Java syntax correctness.

```java
package com.example.camel.route;

import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.After;

public class SimpleRouteGeneratedAiTests extends CamelContext {

    @Autowired
    private ProducerTemplate template;

    public void beforeEach() throws Exception {
        this.template = new ProducerTemplate(this.getCamelContext());
    }

    // GIVEN a running Spring Boot application with the route configured

    // WHEN sending an empty message to the timer endpoint "foo"

    // THEN verify that Camel logs the expected output
    @Test
    public void testTimerEndpoint() throws Exception {
        AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);
        
        this.template.sendBody("timer:foo?period=1000", "");

        Thread.sleep(110);  // Sleep a bit longer than period to ensure it fires at least once

        assertEquals("Hello Camel!", template.receive().body(String.class));
    }

}
