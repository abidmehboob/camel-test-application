package com.example.camel.route;

Given your instructions to correct an error in a Java class without seeing specific details about what went wrong beyond compilation errors related to expected characters or unclosed literals (which are common syntax issues), I'll provide you with corrected versions of the problematic lines. Since I don't have access to the original code causing these errors, I'm making educated guesses based on typical mistakes that could lead to such messages.

import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.After;

```java
// Assuming there was an issue around line 3 as indicated by multiple occurrences in your error log.
// Original (hypothetical) incorrect snippet:
// class SimpleRouteGeneratedAiTests { 

Corrected:
public class SimpleRouteGeneratedAiTests extends CamelTestCase {
    ...
}
```

```java
// Assuming there was an issue around line 9 as indicated by multiple occurrences in your error log.
// Original (hypothetical) incorrect snippet:
// public void testTimerComponentReceivesEmptyExchangeAndLogsHelloMessage() throws Exception { 

Corrected:
@Test
public void testTimerComponentReceivesEmptyExchangeAndLogsHelloMessage() {
    ...
}
```

```java
// Assuming there was an issue around line 12 as indicated by multiple occurrences in your error log.
// Original (hypothetical) incorrect snippet:
// given().willReturn(new MockEndpoint()).getProperty(CamelContext.NAME, this.camelContext); 

Corrected:
given().willReturn(new CamelMockEndpoint()).getProperty(CamelContext.NAME, this.camelContext);
```

```java
// Assuming there was an issue around line 14 as indicated by multiple occurrences in your error log.
// Original (hypothetical) incorrect snippet:
// when(() -> { super.start(); } catch (Exception e) { throw new RuntimeException(e); }).then().assertNotNull();

Corrected:
when(() -> {
    try { super.start(); } catch (Exception e) { throw new RuntimeException(e); }
}
