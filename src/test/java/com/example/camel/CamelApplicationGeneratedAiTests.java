Note: The provided code snippet appears to be missing the test methods and setup logic. If you need tests for a specific public or protected method of `CamelApplication`, please provide more details about what needs testing, so I can generate appropriate unit tests following your instructions.

For example:

```java
// Example if CamelApplication has a public method named 'start' that we want to test:
// GIVEN the application is created and ready.
// WHEN start() is called on it.
// THEN no exception should be thrown.
@Test
public void givenCamelApplication_whenStartCalled_thenNoException() throws Exception {
    assertThat(() -> this.camelApp.start()).doesNotThrowAnyException();
}
